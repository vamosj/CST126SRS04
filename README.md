Purpose:  

- Learn about the role women in Computer Science.  
- Learn about the singly linked list data structure.  
- Learn how to add to, delete, and reverse a singly linked list.  

Instructions:  


Name your project "WICLL".  

Choose 10 women computer scientists for this project.  

You may obtain your list from multiple sources. Here are a couple of examples to get you started:

- [10 Famous Women in Tech History](https://insights.dice.com/2016/03/14/10-famous-women-in-tech-history/)
- [Wikipedia: Women In Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing)

```
Create a class named CSWoman as follows:  

class CSWoman  
{  
private:  
    const std::string name_;  
    const unsigned birthYear_;  
    const std::string fact_;  

public:  
    CSWoman(const char* const name, const unsigned birthYear, const char* const fact);

// ... and other methods  
};  
```

Create 10 CSWoman objects on the heap, each representing a woman pioneer in the field of Computer Science. Provide the information described in the CSWoman ctor described above.  

Place each into a singly-linked list data structure.  

Print the list in any order.  

Reverse the list using the provided algorithm.  

Print the list now in the reverse order.  

Tips:  

- All Class Policy rules apply, including but not limited to memory leaks, testing for nullptr, data corruption.  
- I am expecting a perfect submission and a clean project, even if your code fails to run.
